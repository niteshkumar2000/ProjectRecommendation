# ProjectRecommendation
 Its a Project recomendation system built using Neo4j
# Problem Statement
We have a list of colleges and students studying there. Each student has an interest in some languages and each student worked with other students on some projects. Do an analysis with the help of Graph DB (NEo4j) and try to analyse the case by creating nodes and forming relationships between them.

# Description
    Given data
    - Student name
    - Respective college 
    - Interested programming languages
    - Projects worked
- Neo4j Cypher queries helps us to recommend a project to a student based on several parameters.

# Outcome
- Understanding the creation process of node and relationship using cypher queries.
- Understanding all basic operation provided by Neo4j using cypher query language.
- Implementing aggregate functions in cypher query.
